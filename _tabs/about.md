<H3>Quote that affected whole my life</H3>
<em>"When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down 'happy'. They told me I didn't understand the assignment, and I told them they didn't understand life." - John Lennon</em>

<H3>Teamwork</H3>
Another pleasure is to see the real team's performance. Football team, or in the work - people supporting and understanding each other - they achieve unexpectedly more than one can imagine.

<H3>Bicycle</H3>
Bicycle commuting to work, bicycle rides across the city and to suburbs on weekends. It is a pleasure and fun. Current model - Electra Cruiser. Beautiful and gorgeous creature.
