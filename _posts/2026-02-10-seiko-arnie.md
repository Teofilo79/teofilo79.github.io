New Watch :) Yes, I like watches and do not hide it. <br><br>Dear Arnold, these is tiny chance you will ever read this. But thank you for motivating me in my young years, showing what the man should be. You still inspire me even today, and this watch ... I just look at it and think "What will Arnie do in this case?"<br><br>

Absolutely in love with these! Ticks all the boxes and even more. <br><br>
First of all, I am short-sighted. Which means glasses neded to read or work with laptop, but usually I do not wear them when driving or walking. And this watch has so wonderful legible and thick hands, big numbers and high contrast - I can quickly see the time without glasses even in close distance.
<br><br>
Secondly, unlike many other watches, the titanium case is ... humble! It does not distract you from telling the time when you cast a quick glance. The hands and numbers are the main heroes in this play. And it is perfection.
<br><br>
Also, titanium suits really any outfit!
<br><br>
And the last what I've spotted - this is BIG BEAUTIFUL watch with BIG BEATIFUL hands and BIG BEAUTIFUL numbers and BIG BEATIFUL sapphire glass! Sounds familiar? :) Wonder how the history will remember Trump's presidency actions, but his grotesque view on things will be remembered for a long time.-->
