<h3>Update after few days of wearing:</h3>
<br>
Absolutely in love with these! Ticks all the boxes and even more. <br><br>
First of all, I am short-sighted. Which means glasses neded to read or work with laptop, but usually I do not wear them when driving or walking. And this watch has so wonderful legible and thick hands, big numbers and high contrast - I can quickly see the time without glasses even in close distance.
<br><br>
Secondly, unlike many other watches, the titanium case is ... humble! It does not distract you from telling the time when you cast a quick glance. The hands and numbers are the main heroes in this play. And it is perfection.
<br><br>
Also, titanium suits really any outfit!
<br><br>
And the last what I've spotted - this is BIG BEAUTIFUL watch with BIG BEATIFUL hands and BIG BEAUTIFUL numbers and BIG BEATIFUL sapphire glass! Sounds familiar? :) Wonder how the history will remember Trump's presidency actions, but his grotesque view on things will be remembered for a long time.
