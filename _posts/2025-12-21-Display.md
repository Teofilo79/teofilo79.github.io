<h2>Next JavaScript project - Display Panel</h2>

Here we go!<br><br>
Old style-looking Display with the work tasks, their main information and status - planned dates versus reality. I had a lot of fun combining colors and designs to make it ... whatchammacallit ... eye-pleasing.<br><br>

[TRY IT HERE]({% link pages/Display/Display_panel.html %})

<br><br>

The code is rough and most probably can be cut in half after optimising, but the idea was to practice, not to write something that can be sold or used by anyone else.
<br><br>
Lessons I learned during this build:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>one should definitely have a clear vision of how the final product will look like. I re-written code several times just because after realization I found some features useless and another ones - useful</li>
<li>css can be really long and hard to maintain. Next time I will make more use of variables and properties</li>
<li>JS is not so scary as it seems to be</li>
<li>Monthes start from zero... January is the month number 0. WHYYY....</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
I already have an idea of next project :)
