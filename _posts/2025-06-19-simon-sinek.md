Let me tell you a bit about this man. Optimist. Motivator. Coach. Ted Lasso of the real world. 
<br><br>
I totally share his view on the world and business, he speaks in most clear and understanding words, describing what I always had in mind. Like in the song "Killing me softly with his song, Telling my whole life with his words".
<br><br>
His business is called "Optimism Company" here is a <a href="https://simonsinek.com/" target="_blank">link</a> to the site.
<br><br>
His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SimonSinek" target="_blank">Youtube channel</a>
<br><br>
And I highly recommend listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywl9JXPvikc" target="_blank">this</a> speech.
