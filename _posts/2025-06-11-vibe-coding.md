Faced an interesting trend today - <strong>vibe coding</strong>. Googled. O tempora, o mores!.
<hr>
<em>Vibe coding is a term coined by Andrej Karpathy on x.com that describes an approach to software development where programmers primarily use natural language prompts with AI tools (like LLMs) to generate code rather than manually writing it.</em>

Get it? You do not need to know the code. You need to learn how to speak AI language. There are plenty youtube videos of people doing hard work using AI. With just copying code. God, this is crazy, but it works.
