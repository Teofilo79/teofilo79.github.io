Faced an interesting trend today - <strong>vibe coding</strong>. Googled. O tempora, o mores!.
<hr>
<em>Vibe coding is a term coined by Andrej Karpathy on x.com that describes an approach to software development where programmers primarily use natural language prompts with AI tools (like LLMs) to generate code rather than manually writing it.</em>
<hr>
Get it? You do not need to know the code. You need to learn how to speak AI language. There are plenty youtube videos of people doing hard work using AI. With just copying code. God, this is crazy, but it works. What do I think of it.<br><br>
If you copy the code and spend time studying and examining how it works - this is wonderful. You learn new things on practice. 100% effectiveness.<br><br>
If you just use the code to create the things you are unable to create cause you lack knowledge - also fine! There is one tricky thing - you will not do it without at least basic knowledge of that programming language. So you learn anyway.
<br><br>
God, I need to spend some time on it. Goes to the task list, which is already quite big...
